## ❓About
Specs is an Android App developed with Flutter that allows users and developers to view detailed specifications of your Android device.

I developed this app because I was annoyed of me always forgetting my devices SKD/API level and had to search it up all the time. This inspired me to create "Specs".

## 📱Features
- View detailed device specifications
- Access information such as Android version, API level, device model, manufacturer, and more
- Simple interface
- Follows Material 3 design principles

Don't judge my code.
