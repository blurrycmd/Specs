#### 📲 Easily view essential Android device specs. All the details, right at a glance.

## ❓About

Specs is an Android App developed with Flutter that allows users and developers to view detailed specifications of their Android device.

I developed this app because I was annoyed of me always forgetting my devices SKD/API level and had to search it up all the time. This inspired me to create "Specs".

## 📱Features

- View detailed device specifications
- Access information such as Android version, API level, device model, manufacturer, and more
- Simple interface
- Follows Material 3 design principles

This is my first Flutter app, and I am still learning. If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Don't judge my code. I created this app in under 24 hours.
